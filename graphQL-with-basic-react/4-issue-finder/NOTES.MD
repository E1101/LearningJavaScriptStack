We will be using create-react-app tsc and graphql-codegen to setup our workspace.

`graphql-codegen` will generate Typescript types for us and some handy wrappers to simplify the usage of several Apollo methods.

So to get started run:
```
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-fullstack-apollo
```

This installs all dependencies needed to build and test a React + TypeScript + Apollo app.


copy of the `create-react-app` template could be found in source codes root.
