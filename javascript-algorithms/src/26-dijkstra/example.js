   B: 13,
   C: 8,
   D: 8,
   E: 10,
   Office: 14,

// let's figure out what is the shortest path that has a shortest distance.
console.log(previousVertices.Office.getKey()); // -> 'E'
console.log(previousVertices.E.getKey()); // -> 'C'
console.log(previousVertices.C.getKey()); // -> 'A'
console.log(previousVertices.A.getKey()); // -> 'Home'

// So the shortest path from Home to Office is:
// Home -> A -> C -> E -> Office
